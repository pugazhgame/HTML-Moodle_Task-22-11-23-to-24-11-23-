    <h3>Diwali Celebrations</h3>
    <p1>Diwali, also known as Deepawali, is a major Hindu festival marking the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya, after defeating Ravana. It symbolises the victory of good over evil and light over darkness. People decorate their homes with lights, flowers and rangoli, wear new clothes, and exchange gifts. Special prayers are offered to Goddess Lakshmi for prosperity. Diyas (clay lamps) are lit to signify hope and light's victory. Traditionally, firecrackers were used to ward off evil, but there's a growing eco-friendly awareness now. Diwali brings families together, spreading happiness, reflecting on the power of light, and cherishing the good things in life.</p1>

 <h1>Why Do We Celebrate Diwali?</h1>
    <p>Diwali is celebrated to mark the victory of good over evil and light over darkness. On this day, Shri Ram returned to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile, defeating Ravana. Citizens of Ayodhya decorated their homes and the whole city with lighted diyas. Since then, Diwali has been celebrated with the lighting of diyas and the bursting of firecrackers. Another reason to celebrate Diwali is that it is the beginning of the new year in many parts of India. Diwali celebration also marks the liberation of Goddess Lakshmi, who was imprisoned by King Bali. Lord Vishnu, in disguise, rescued her from the king, giving reason for the joyful celebration of Diwali in many regions, as it symbolises the coming of the revered Goddess Lakshmi to peopleâ€™s homes. Many people believe that She will bless them with wealth and prosperity in the coming year. Lastly, it also celebrates the harvest season since it falls at the end of the harvest season in India.
