    <main style="background-color: tomato;"><p> I'm Pugazhendhi Vishwanadhan. I took a cool turn from studying Pharmaceutical Technology to diving headfirst into Full Stack Development. I spent my college days wrapping my head around science and precision.

        But, the tech bug bit me hard, and I ventured into the world of coding. It's like combining two worldsâ€”the logic of science and the creative flair of tech. I see myself as a storyteller, just using code to weave digital tales that people can enjoy.
        
        My goal was building stuff that's not just functional but feels like second nature to anyone using it. Every challenge in this tech universe is a chance to learn, grow, and keep pushing the boundaries. That's my jam!</p></main>
